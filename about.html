                 <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                 <p>I am a first year Architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University, I am enjoying my classes and thoroughly intrigued by the world of architecture. I want to expand upon my Architectural education by attaining a summer internship. By attaining this internship I hope to both get a better grasp on the professional world of architecture as well as build upon my skills.</p> 
                 
                 <p>Architecture has inspired me since high school, this year at CMU I have been learning the skills and programs to help me be part of a team. Through the use of the Adobe suits, Rhino and V-Ray in Media class as well as previous experiences in Revit and Sketch up I am at a point where I can help contribute to a team an an Intern. With my experience working on a team and take criticism in the studio I will be able to thrive in an internship position. </p>
